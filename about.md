Matt Desmond raised the issue of evictions as a cause, not just a consequence of poverty with the publication of Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City — a narrative accompaniment to years of ethnographic work in Milwaukee. 

A significant gap in Matt Desmond’s work and existing research in general involves the existence of tools for policymakers and government to identify and monitor exploitative landlords engaging in eviction in an ongoing basis. Furthermore, legal defense strategies reactively represent individuals that have the means to show up in court. Eviction and its consequences are spatially concentrated in specific areas and may benefit from representation strategies that are spatially informed. 

To combat these gaps, this research will focus on developing a suite of metrics and tools that give government and legal defense stakeholders the ability to make informed and strategic operational decisions around eviction case outcomes and exploitative landlords.  The final product will take the form of an interactive, filterable series of maps and dashboards built in Tableau. An accompanying report detailing methods, assumptions, and limitations of the study will be provided.
